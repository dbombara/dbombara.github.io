# Qualification of Spaceborne Phase-Changing Materials (PCM) for Low-Earth Orbit (LEO)

The tables below detail the academic research laboratories, companies, and space agencies that are studying or have studied the effects of the low-earth orbit (LEO) environment on various materials (not necessarily PCMs). The materials are evaluated either in (a) simulated LEO conditions or (b) _in situ_ through missions to LEO.
