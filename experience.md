I began my research career at the ***Smart Robotics Laboratory*** at the University of Nevada, Reno Mechanical Engineering Department (2018–Present). My work has involved the experimental characterization, modeling, and control of **soft actuators and soft robots**. For this research, I exercise mechatronics skills such as C++ programming and circuit prototyping for automated motor control and data acquisition. I also apply mathematical models (both data-driven and physics-based) to describe the mechanics of these actuators and robots. In this lab, I published my work in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters and Soft Robotics as the first-author.

The second main aspect of my research career thus far was through a virtual internship with **NASA Langley Research Center** (June 2020–May 2021). I worked with a research team that is developing **actively tunable optical filters** made from **phase-changing materials**. My research conducted through this internship is published in SPIE’s Optical Engineering with myself as the first author.

Another great experience I had was my 10 weeks as an intern at **NASA Ames Research Center** (June–August 2019). My research project for this internship was to develop a proof-of-concept terrestrial robot for use in urban search and rescue applications. For this experience, I surveyed the state-of-the-art in (terrestrial and aerial) **robotic search and rescue**. I also gained hands-on experience programming the robot’s sensors and developing wireless communication for the sensors’ data.

For the 2021–2022, I am funded by the **NASA Space Technology Graduate Research Opportunities (NSTGRO) fellowship**. The work for this fellowship is related to my previous work in the Smart Robotics Laboratory, but with a specific focus on the applications of the soft actuators and soft robots to space technology.
