# Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. student at the [Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/). I am supported by the [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) program and the Harvard Graduate Prize Fellowship.

I graduated with a Master of Science in mechanical engineering in August 2022 from the [University of Nevada, Reno](https://www.unr.edu/). I completed my research in the [Smart Robotics Laboratory](https://packpages.unr.edu/jun).

I spent the summer of 2022 at [NASA Johnson Space Center](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/home/index.html) as a visiting researcher. I worked in the [Dexterous Robotics Laboratory](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/partnerships/eddc/ra/dexterous-robotics-laboratory) within the [Robotic Systems Technology Branch](https://er.jsc.nasa.gov/er4/).
