My undergraduate background is **mechanical engineering**, but now in graduate school my studies have been more interdisciplinary. For my master’s degree program, my coursework has focused on **control theory** for both **linear and nonlinear systems**, with coursework from the **electrical engineering** and mechanical engineering departments. I also took a graduate-level course on **machine learning** (named “Machine Intelligence”). My coursework has enabled me to study the complex (and nonlinear) systems that are artificial muscles and soft robotics. My undergraduate background gave me a broad base of knowledge that enables me to tackle a wide range of problems related to electrical and mechanical engineering.
