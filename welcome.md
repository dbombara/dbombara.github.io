# Hello!

I am currently pursuing a **Master of Science in mechanical engineering** at the University of Nevada, Reno. My broad research interests include nonlinear control systems, soft robotics, and phase-changing materials with applications to space technology.

I am also a **NASA Space Technology Graduate Researcher** for 2021-2022, funded by the NASA Space Technology Mission Directorate. I obtained my bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering in 2020 from the University of Nevada, Reno. I have first-authored publications in *Soft Robotics*, *SPIE Optical Engineering* and *IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters*.

Previously, I have interned at **NASA Ames Research Center** and **NASA Langley Research Center**. At Ames, I interned in the Aeromechanics Branch and at Langley, I interned in the Advanced Measurements and Data Systems Branch.
